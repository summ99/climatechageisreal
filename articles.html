          <a href = "https://climate.nasa.gov/scientific-consensus/">  Scientific Consensus: Earth's Climate is Warming </a> <!-- NOTE: title of article -->
            <p> Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing
              climate scientists agree*: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities.
              In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. <!-- NOTE: brief summary -->

            larval transport </a> <!-- NOTE: title of article -->
            <p> Many marine species have migrated towards the poles as water temperatures warm. In contrast, due to changes in the timing
              of spawning and transport, benthic invertebrates on the Northwest Atlantic continental shelf are pushed into warmer waters
              where mortality could be higher.<!-- NOTE: brief summary -->

          <a href = "https://climate.nasa.gov/news/3023/2020-arctic-sea-ice-minimum-at-second-lowest-on-record/">  2020 Arctic Sea Ice Minimum at Second Lowest on Record </a> <!-- NOTE: title of article -->
            <p> This yearâ€™s Arctic sea ice cover shrank to the second lowest extent since modern record-keeping began in the late
              1970s, at 1.44 million square miles (3.74 million square kilometers). <!-- NOTE: brief summary -->
