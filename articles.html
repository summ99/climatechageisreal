            <p> Multiple studies published in peer-reviewed scientific journals show that 97 percent or more of actively publishing
              climate scientists agree*: Climate-warming trends over the past century are extremely likely due to human activities.
              In addition, most of the leading scientific organizations worldwide have issued public statements endorsing this position. <!-- NOTE: brief summary -->

            <p> Climate change could add around 20% to the global cost of extreme weather events by 2040, according to early findings from Cambridge researchers, who are urging businesses to evaluate their
              own exposures to the growing risk to improve their resilience and sustainability.<!-- NOTE: brief summary -->

            <p> This yearâ€™s Arctic sea ice cover shrank to the second lowest extent since modern record-keeping began in the late
              1970s, at 1.44 million square miles (3.74 million square kilometers). <!-- NOTE: brief summary -->
